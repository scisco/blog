<span><a href=https://blog.scisco.io/fa/about/>in Persian</a></span></div><div class=taxonomies></div><hr><div class=content><p>I am an engineer working for a technology company in Seattle with a diverse professional background. I began my career as a journalist and worked in that field before transitioning to a non-profit where I worked on election projects. Due to my coding and technical skills, I became involved in technology projects, and eventually joined a small tech company where I helped establish their satellite imagery service area during a rebranding effort. After six years there, I moved to a larger company to improve their utilization of satellite imagery in their ag-tech product. However, that role did not work out, and I joined my current employer, where I am focused on search at scale.</p><p>In my free time, I enjoy reading widely on various topics and keeping up with current events. Additionally, I love running because it provides me with time to immerse myself in my dreams and simulate different storylines in my head that I wouldn&rsquo;t try in real life. A few years ago, I came up with the pseudonym &ldquo;scisco&rdquo; for my self, which is Latin for &ldquo;I inquire,&rdquo; &ldquo;I ask,&rdquo; or &ldquo;I learn.&rdquo;</p><p>As for hobbies, I also enjoy climbing, hiking, and biking. ðŸ‘‹</p></div></section></div><div class=side><div class=side-recent><h2 class=side-title>Recent Posts</h2><hr><ul><li><a href=/posts/hi/>Writing Again</a></li></ul></div><div class=side-categories><h2>Categories</h2><hr><ul><li><a href=/categories/general>General (1)</a></li></ul></div></div></main><footer class=footer><div class=footer-row><a class=footer-item href=https://blog.scisco.io/posts/index.xml>Feed of Posts
